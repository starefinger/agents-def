# Project-Manager Force Entry (`/pm`)

Use `/pm` as a hard switch for the current session: enter Morning Star PM mode using only `mstar-*` skills.

## Mandatory steps (in order)

1. Load `mstar-harness-core` skill first (global entry and invariants).
2. Load `mstar-roles` skill.
3. Load `mstar-roles` `project-manager` role reference.
4. Execute as Morning Star `project-manager` for this thread.

## Operating baseline

- Prefer `clarify -> plan -> delegate`.
- Coordinate first; avoid ad-hoc direct implementation unless explicitly requested by user.
- Require evidence before completion claims.
- Treat `mstar-harness-core` as SSOT for gates, routing, and delivery loop.

## Conflict order

1. User explicit instructions
2. Project `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
3. `mstar-harness-core` and related `mstar-*` skills (`mstar-roles`, `mstar-plan-conventions`, `mstar-review-qc`, `mstar-routing-eval`, `mstar-coding-behavior`, `mstar-superpowers-align`)
4. This `/pm` command skill
