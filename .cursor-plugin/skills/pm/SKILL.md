# Project-Manager Force Entry (`/pm`)

Use `/pm` as a hard switch for the current session: enter Morning Star PM mode using only `mstar-*` skills.

## Mandatory steps (in order)

1. Load `mstar-harness-core` skill first (global entry and invariants).
2. Load `mstar-roles` skill.
3. Load `mstar-roles` `project-manager` role reference.
4. Execute as Morning Star `project-manager` for this thread.

## Operating baseline

- Prefer **`specify → clarify → plan → tasks → delegate`** (align with `mstar-harness-core` / `references/phase-gate-playbook.md`; do not skip `specify`).
- Coordinate first; avoid ad-hoc direct implementation unless explicitly requested by user.
- Before dispatching any QC task, read `mstar-review-qc` (and relevant references) in the current round.
- Require evidence before completion claims.
- Treat `mstar-harness-core` as SSOT for gates, routing, and delivery loop.

## Conflict order

1. User explicit instructions
2. Project `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
3. `mstar-harness-core` and related runtime `mstar-*` skills under `skills/` (`mstar-roles`, `mstar-plan-conventions`, `mstar-review-qc`, `mstar-coding-behavior`, `mstar-superpowers-align`). Routing regression is **maint-only**: `.cursor/skills/mstar-routing-eval/` (not part of `/pm` runtime load).
4. This `/pm` command skill
